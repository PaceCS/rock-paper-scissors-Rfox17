# Rock, Paper, Scissors

You will be re-creating the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors.  You will do this inside the file **logic.js**.  You will need to give the user a list of options to choose from.  They can either be the classic options (Rock, Paper, and Scissors) or you can make up your own.  Then, you will create a function **playGame** that will accept the user's choice as an input.  Your function should do all of the following actions.
- Remind the user of their choice.
- Randomly assign an option to the computer.  (Note: Math.random() will be needed here.)
- Tell the user which choice the computer made.
- Tell the user who won and why.

Below are some sample examples of the game.
